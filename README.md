## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the notebook in Google Colab:

**Step 1**: Open the Notebook in Colab

Click on the "Open In Colab" badge next to the heart_disease.ipynb file in the README. This will open the notebook in Google Colab.

**Step 2**: Sign in to Google Account

If you are not already signed in to a Google account, you will be prompted to sign in or create a Google account.

**Step 3 (Optional)**: Copy the Notebook to Your Google Drive (Optional)

For a seamless experience and to save your changes, click on the "Copy to Drive" option in the Colab toolbar. This will create a copy of the notebook in your Google Drive.

**Step 4**: Run the Notebook Cells

- Understanding Cells: In a Jupyter notebook, the content is organized into "cells." Each cell can contain either text or code.

- Running Code Cells: The interactive part of the notebook is usually in the form of code cells. To execute the code and see the results, you need to "run" these cells.

- Locating the Play Button: Look for a "play button" icon near the top-left corner of each code cell. This button is what you'll use to run the code within that specific cell.

**Step 5(Optional)**: Save Your Changes (if running on a copy)

If you made changes and are running a copy in your Google Drive, make sure to save the notebook. You can do this by clicking on "File" in the Colab toolbar and selecting "Save a copy in Drive" or "Save" if it's an existing copy.
